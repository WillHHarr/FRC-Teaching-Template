This code is developed in hopes of a template that can support a number of differing motor controller types as well as differing swerve module configurations to support the development of intermixed robots.
Special thanks must go to FRC Team 3512 (and 364, the creaters of the original ported repository) of whose code was the base to work off of, which a lot of the base Swerve logic was taken from, for the rest to be built on top of.

This Repository is made in hopes of supporting

As well, this repository also utilizes the ratios for the MK4i modules from Swerve Drive Specialties of the L2 variation, although double checking these ratios as to if they are still true would be advised.

The control system assumption with this current revision of the program controls is with a xbox controller, or at minimum a controller recognized by the drive station as xbox.

SmartDashboard is used for data feedback to the user-client of the driver station.
